#The goal of this assignment

The goal is to

- write one (or more) custom functions that do something useful to pieces of the Gapminder data. 

- Use `dplyr::do()` to apply to all such pieces. 

- Use `dplyr()` and or `ggplot2` to explore what you got back.


The mission is __high-level__: to Write a function to compute something interesting on a piece of the Gapminder data. Make it something can’t easily do with built-in functions. Make it something that’s not trivial to do with the simple `dplyr` verbs.
