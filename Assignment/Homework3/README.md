=====================================

## The goal of this assignment 
The goal is to 

- manipulate and explore a dataset with the `dplyr package`.

- complemented by visualizations made with `ggplot2`. 

In particular, we keep our focus on working with a data.frame (but note: `dplyr` can work with other data storage formats seamlessly).
