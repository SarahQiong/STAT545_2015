### Overview

[slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/ubc-stat545-2014-cm107-and-cm108-context-for-writing-your-first-r-package-week)

  * What is an R package?
  * What is a library?
  * Why make an R package?
  * Why `devtools` is integral to a happy workflow.

### Prepare your system for package development

[System prep and testing](packages01_system-prep.html)

Although we'll build a very simple package, we're still going to use the most modern and powerful tools for R package development. In theory, this could eventually involve compiling C/C++ code, which means you need what's called a "build environment." Follow the link above for help preparing your system.
  
### Hands-on activity

We build the `gameday` package to check if your favorite NHL team has a game today.

This fully developed example shows you

  * How to create a new R package
  * How to accept help from `devtools` and RStudio during development
  * Workflow for package development
  * How to document functions and your overall package
  * How to test the functions in your package
  * How to demonstrate your package's utility with a vignette
  * How to put your package on GitHub to share with the world

[Day 1](packages02_activity.html) of hands-on work

[Day 2](packages03_activity_part2.html) of hands-on work

[Homework](hw10_package.html) that builds on the in-class work on `gameday`. [Hints](hw10_package_jenny-hints.html) on how to get started. [Peer review help](hw10_package_peer-review.html).

### Resources

__R packages__ is a work-in-progress by Hadley Wickham. To be published as a book by O'Reilly in 2015. Already a valuable resource:

Hilary Parker's [blog post](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) on the epiphany of writing her first R package

  * "I was hit with that familiar feeling of the joy of optimization combined with the regret of past inefficiencies (joygret?). I wish I could go back in time and create the package the first moment I thought about it, and then use all the saved time to watch cat videos because that really would have been more productive."

[October 2014 blog post](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/10/02/devtools-1-6/) announcing release of `devtools` v1.6 gives a nice overview of the latest helper functions for package developers

[`testthat`: Get Started with Testing](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf), an article written by Hadley Wickham for *The R Journal,* Vol. 3/1, June 2011, pp. 5-10. *This may no longer be correct in every last detail, due to evolution of `testthat`, but it still makes an excellent, readable introduction to unit testing in R (packages)*.

[How R Searches and Finds Stuff](http://obeautifulcode.com/R/How-R-Searches-And-Finds-Stuff/) is a fairly technical blog post for understanding the R search path, but also gives some great explanations on some differences between `Imports` vs `Depends` and why Depends is safer (added by daattali on 2015-01-01)
