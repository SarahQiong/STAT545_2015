We are seeking more TAs for STAT 545A and STAT 547M, September - December 2015. Hang out with [these fine co-instructors](people.html)! *If you would be perfect for this, but you're not a UBC student, there may be [other opportunities](#other-opportunities).*

## Time commitment and pay

  * **We are seeking the equivalent of at least one additional full TA, from one person or from a combination of people.**
  * A full TAship is 12 hours per week, according to the [CUPE 2278 Collective Agreement](http://cupe2278.ca/documents-and-information/collective-agreement/) (192 hours per term / 16 weeks in a term = 12 hours per week).
  * Pay is roughly $30 per hour.
  * Eligibility: TA must be a registered UBC student.
  * We are open to all possible arrangements:
    - Full TA all term
    - Full TA for a part of the term
    - Part-time TA all term
    - Part-time TA for a part of the term
  * In 2014, the course was TA'd by an [amazing team of 6 TAs](people.html), who worked on different pieces of the course, at different times. It works.

## Responsibilities

As a team, here's what must get done:

  * Attend class meetings, help students during hands-on exercises
  * Contribute to course material (all on GitHub, all on the web), improving existing lessons or developing new ones
  * Hold in-person office hours
  * Interact with students on GitHub, in their private course repositories and in our public [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) repo
  * Mark homework assignments and peer reviews
  * Maintain and improve course infrastructure, such as the main repository / website
  
## Qualifications

  * You have taken STAT 545A or STAT 545A + STAT 547M. Or, [based on what you see online](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/topics.html), you have equivalent experience, at least in some areas.
    - Each TA **does not need to be in control of all the material or comfortable in every setting**. We do this as a team.
    - Feel free to identify areas of strength and areas where you'd be in over your head. It is OK to use your TAship to solidify your knowledge of an area that interests you.
  * You are enthusiastic and experienced with
    - R
    - RStudio
    - git and GitHub
    - R Markdown
  * You are genuinely interested in exploratory data analysis and associated workflows.
  * You have an interest in teaching.

## Other opportunities <a id="other-opportunities"></a>
