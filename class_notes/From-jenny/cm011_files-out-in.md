### cm011 2014-10-08 Wednesday overview

  * [HW05](hw05_factor-boss-files-out-in.html) will be due Thursday 2014-10-16. Will cover reordering factors and data; verifying differences in tables/figs before vs after, and how such things interact with different methods of storing data to file.
  * Expect an optional, non-marked homework around the STAT545 --> STAT547 transition
    - clean up your `README.md`
    - create a useful index into your homework / entire repo
    - identify some non-Gapminder data that interests you and might interest others
  * I'm still thinking about Wednesday vs Thursday vs Friday as HW submission day for next half of term....
  * Today
    - HW02 observations *I will post what I showed somewhere private to us and publicize a link*
    - Writing (derived) data to file: when to do it which way
    - [Indicative code from our hands on activities](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm011_files-out-in-script.r)
    - [2013 lesson](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/block05_getNumbersOut.html) *will be brought into 2014 repo; no major content change but will, e.g., switch over to `dplyr`*
  * Monday 2014-10-13
    - NO CLASS. THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY.
  * Wednesday 2014-10-15 
    - Back to figs: effective graphs, be the boss of colors
    - I'm taking suggestions over on the [Discussion repo](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/36). Can't promise to cover everything in class, but will provide some response if possible.
