Although we'll build a very simple package, we're still going to use the most modern and powerful tools for R package development. In theory, this could eventually involve compiling C/C++ code, which means you need what's called a *build environment*.

### Update R and RStudio

Embarking on your career as an R package developer is an important milestone. Why not celebrate by updating R and RStudio? This is something we recommended early and we recommend doing it often. [Go back to Day 0 of the course](block000_r-rstudio-install.html#r-and-rstudio) for reminders on the process.

*2014-11 FYI: TA Bernhard was running R version 3.1.2 and RStudio 0.98.1056 during this lesson.*

### Special considerations for Windows

Sorry folks! Yes here we are again, installing software together while the Mac people sit there looking smug.

*Warning: we are still weighing various recommendations for what Windows users should do. You can probably get by for quite a while without installing `Rtools` as described below, but it will eventually be come necessary and the `devtools` package will alert you to this. For example, once your package development/building activities involve compiling code, you will need `Rtools`.*

You need to install `Rtools`. This is __NOT an R package__ but is rather "a collection of resources for building packages for R under Microsoft Windows, or for building R itself". Go here and do what it says:

<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

Note the repeated advice to stay current: "We recommend that users use the latest release of `Rtools` with the latest release of R."

### R packages to help you build yet more R packages

Install the following packages. If you already have them, update them. *versions reflect TA Bernhard's system when lesson was delivered 2014-11*

  * `devtools` 1.6.1
  * `roxygen2` 4.0.2
  * `testthat` 0.9.1
  * `knitr` 1.7

Example of how to check which version of a package you've got installed:

```r
`packageVersion("devtools")`
```
        
Example of how to install a package and all it's dependencies:

```r
`install.packages("devtools", dependencies = TRUE)`
```

See how profound your problem with out-of-date packages is:

```r
`old.packages()`
```
        
Just update everything:

```r
`update.packages(ask = FALSE)`
```
        
__CAVEAT:__ The above examples will only consult your default library and default CRAN mirror. If you want to target a non-default library, use function arguments to say so. Packages that you have installed from GitHub? You'll need to check the current-ness of your version and perform upgrades yourself.
